# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

As maintainers & contributors, we try to keep the range of supported Rust compiler versions as wide as possible
to avoid unnecessary inconvenience for smart contract developers. However, we **give up** all strong MSRV guarantees
as the Rust ecosystem currently makes it impossible to do so.
